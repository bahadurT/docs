TensorRT 8.0: Whatâ€™s New
TensorRT 8.0 is packed with new features like Quantization aware training for accurate INT8, Sparsity support for leveraging Ampere GPUs, and inference optimizations for Transformer-based networks.

Highlights:

Achieve accuracy equivalent to FP32 with INT8 precision using Quantization Aware Training
Support for Sparsity on Ampere GPUs delivers up to 50% higher throughput on Ampere GPUs
Upto 2x faster inference for transformer based networks like BERT with new compiler optimizations
TensorRT 8.0 will be freely available to members of NVIDIA Developer Program in Q2, 2021
